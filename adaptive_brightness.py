LtChipotle's Adaptive Brightness Algorithm
==========================================
Improved version.
Modify the following variables to adjust the algorithm:

    
    User variables: 
    - sensitivity_factor: Adjusts how sensitive the algorithm is to changes in light, higher values = steeper curve
    - min_brigthness_level: Adjusts the minimum brightness level, higher values = brighter minimum brightness
    - step: Step size to adjust brightness by
    - pause: Pause brightness adjustments
    - silent: Silence all logging

    To adjust the algorithm to your liking play with:
    - sensitivity_factor (higher values = steeper curve) This value shrinks/grows the curve. (Values under 1, make the curve flatter and also limit the max brightness, use sensor shift instead)
    - min_brightness_level (higher values = brighter minimum brightness) This value shifts the curve up/down.
    - step (higher values = faster adjustments) This value controls how fast the brightness changes. (resolution)
    - sensor_shift: This value shifts the curve left/right.(This might be better to adjust rather than the sensitivity factor)


    Some profiles, which are not implemented yet, but can be used as a reference:
    Profile: reading
    Configuration Without Shift: {'sensitivity_factor': 0.8, 'min_brightness_level': 100, 'step': 50}
    Suggested Sensor Shift Range: 0 to 100

    Profile: day
    Configuration Without Shift: {'sensitivity_factor': 1.5, 'min_brightness_level': 200, 'step': 100}
    Suggested Sensor Shift Range: 150 to 250

    Profile: evening
    Configuration Without Shift: {'sensitivity_factor': 1.2, 'min_brightness_level': 50, 'step': 50}
    Suggested Sensor Shift Range: 100 to 200

    Profile: movie
    Configuration Without Shift: {'sensitivity_factor': 0.5, 'min_brightness_level': 80, 'step': 20}
    Suggested Sensor Shift Range: 200 to 300

    Profile: night
    Configuration Without Shift: {'sensitivity_factor': 0.3, 'min_brightness_level': 10, 'step': 30}
    Suggested Sensor Shift Range: 50 to 150  

    Default: {sensitivity_factor': 1.0, 'min_brightness_level': 150, 'step': 50, 'sensor_shift': 150}
    Sensitivity Factor: 1.0
        This represents a moderate sensitivity to ambient light changes. The sensitivity factor determines how aggressively the algorithm responds to changes in the sensor's light readings.
    Minimum Brightness Level: 150
        This sets the lowest brightness level that the screen will adjust to. A value of 150 ensures that the screen remains visible and comfortable to view in low-light conditions, while not being overly bright in darker environments.
    Step: 50
        This value represents the increment or decrement step size for brightness adjustments. A step size of 50 strikes a balance between smooth transitions (avoiding abrupt changes in brightness) and timely responsiveness to changes in ambient light.
    Sensor Shift: 150
        The sensor shift value of 150 effectively shifts the brightness adjustment curve to the right. This means that the algorithm will start adjusting the brightness at higher sensor values, helping to avoid unnecessary adjustments due to minor fluctuations in light, which is particularly useful during varying light conditions throughout the day.



    Developer only variables: (Use these only if you know what you're doing)
    - num_readings: Number of sensor readings to average over
    - max_sensor_value: Maximum sensor value, used to scale the sensor readings
    - backlight_device: Backlight device name, used to locate the brightness file
    - max_backlight_value: Maximum brightness value, used to cap the brightness

    Example systemd service file: (Replace /path/to/ with the actual path to the script)
    location example '/etc/systemd/system/adaptive_brightness.service'
